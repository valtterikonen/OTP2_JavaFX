# JavaFX UI Localization for Car Rental App

This project aims to add comprehensive Japanese language support to the Car Rental Application.

## Project Steps

### 1. Define: Understand the Problem and Set Clear Objectives
   - **Objective:** Add Japanese localization for all UI elements.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Review the current UI to identify missing Japanese translations.
     - Prepare a list of UI components needing localization.
   - **Expected Outcome:** A clear plan for implementing full Japanese localization in the UI.

### 2. Measure: Collect Data to Understand the Current State
   - **Objective:** Identify non-localized text by tracking app usage.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Enable logging to capture untranslated text during runtime.
     - Review logs to find untranslated or incorrectly localized UI elements.
   - **Expected Outcome:** A list of all missing or incorrect Japanese translations.

### 3. Analyze: Identify Root Causes of Defects
   - **Objective:** Determine why localization defects occur.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Investigate the source of missing or incorrect translations (e.g., hardcoded strings, missing resources).
     - Differentiate between missing translations and incorrect ones.
   - **Expected Outcome:** A detailed list of root causes for localization issues.

### 4. Improve: Develop and Implement Solutions
   - **Objective:** Correct identified localization issues.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Translate missing text and correct errors in existing translations.
     - Test the Japanese localization to ensure accuracy and functionality.
   - **Expected Outcome:** A fully localized UI with correct Japanese translations.

### 5. Control: Ensure the Improvements Are Sustained
   - **Objective:** Maintain localization quality over time.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Implement automated tests to check for untranslated text in new or updated UI components.
     - Schedule regular testing to catch future localization issues.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Sustained translation quality, with automated checks to ensure future consistency.

## Expected Outcome
Upon completion of these steps, the application will fully support Japanese localization. Automated quality control measures will ensure consistent translation quality as the application evolves.
